    <p>These lettuce cups are great if you are trying to cut back on some carbs, using lettuce instead of tortillas.
        If using lean ground turkey for the recipe, it can help keep the fat under control but you lose that flavor,
        that's where the amazing Asian flavored sauce comes in.
    </p>
    <p>Using a combination of low sodium soy sauce, hosin, rice vinegar, chile paste and toasted sesame oil, with these
        ingrediants it can greatly affect the taste of this recipe.
        As well as having a nice served stomach.
