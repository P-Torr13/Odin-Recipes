  <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
    <h4>Chili Sesame Sauce</h4>
      <li>1/2 cup peanut butter</li>
      <li>1/3 cup sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cup light low sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chili paste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 knob of fresh ginger, peeled and grated</li>
    <h4>Zoodles and Tofu</h4>
      <li>12 ounces extra firm tofu</li>
      <li>4-6 zucchini</li>
      <li>Sesame seeds and scallions for toppings</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Chili Sesame Sauce:</strong> Shake all the sauce ingredients in a jar or toss them in the food processor and give
          them a whirl. If you are going to have this cold, refrigerate your sauce for a while.</li>
      <li><strong>Tofu:</strong>Press excess moisture out of the tofu. Cut into bite sized pieces. Heat a tiny bit of oil in a
          nonstick pan. Add the tofu and stir fry until golden brown. Add about 1/2 cup sauce and simmer until the
          sauce starts to evaporate / absorb into the tofu and becomes browned in the pan. Keep gently flipping and
          scraping browned bits off the bottom, after a while, you should end up with nicely golden brown tofu with
          some little yummy browned bits from the sauce.</li>
      <li><strong>Together:</strong> Spiralize your zucchini and toss with about 1/4 cup sauce per serving. Top with tofu, sesame
          seeds, and scallions. Serve immediately</li>
    </ol>
